# 1. what is the difference between a commit and a push?
Commit saves the changes you made only to the local repository but not to the remote repository. When you use the push command, you apply your changes to the upstream repository. 

# 2. what is the difference between push and pull?
Push commands push the local repository content onto a remote repository, to share the modifications with remote team members. Pull commands fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the local repository.

# 3. when do you need to pull?
You use pull when you want to merge the new code changes with the main project repository on your local machine.
